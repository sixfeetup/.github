### :question: What question are we asking?

Define clearly the deliverable(s) of the research and how detailed it should be.

### :flying_saucer: What is the scope?

Keep the reasearch focused on the right objective, defined by the business problem we're solving.

### :alarm_clock: How long do we have to find an answer?

Timebox the research before we have to make the best decision we can so we don't burn too much budget on this question alone.

### :notebook: Where are we logging our findings?

The Github repo is the best place in general but maybe not here. Keep track of all findings.

### :memo: Additional context

Add any other context about the research objective here, such as points of contact, starting references, etc.

### :spider_web: Dependencies (Optional)
